# Resources
The start of a collection of resources that are useful for learning single-cell RNAseq analysis in R.

## Online Tutorials
### scRNA-seq 
#### Workflows

[Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis](https://osca.bioconductor.org/): a really comprehensive guide for analysing single-cell data using bioconductor packages (`scater` and `scran`, rather than `seurat`). Includes step-by-step anaylsis of number of example datasets.

Sanger single cell course:

Quick and dirty way of analysing sc data:
[A step-by-step workflow for low-level analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data with Bioconductor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112579/)

#### Useful packages
[Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html) is an excellent tool which facilitates the analyses of scRNAseq data. 

### R 
As with many languages [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a great place to start particularly the [Learn R series](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r).

Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Hadley is the author of a number of very popular R packages, particularly within the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), this guide is a great introduction to some of the tidyverse tools for handling and visualising data in R.

For some more advanced advice about good-practice for managing projects in R [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/) is short, accessible, and very useful.


### Rmarkdown
To get yourself acquainted with Rmarkdown, you can start with documentation in the Rstudio page: [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). A more comprehensive guide for the enthusiast can be found in Yihui's [Rmarkdown: The definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
